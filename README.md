# Camera Assistant

## Start Guide

Clone or download this repository into a folder of your choice and run ```CameraAssistant.py```.

## Important Notes

1. You may be required to install certain Python packages, such as bs4, pyppeteer, termplotlib, and numpy. Please see ```requirements.txt``` for all dependencies. You may find ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` to be useful.
2. pyppeteer performs scraping operation using a [headless browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser). That means it may automatically install a compatible version of chromium browser on your computer (~100MB)
3. Occasionally, the scraper may malfunction because the host websites are changed or unresponsive. This is most likely not your error as a user.
